                    <h2>About</h2>
                        <p style="color:black;font-weight: bold;">ZeroGrad is a site where we believe that employers need a better way to share entry-level jobs with fresh and eager graduates. We don't believe experience is the issue when applying to jobs but rather a miscommunication between the hiring companies and job seekers; Zerograd attempts to build a strong communication between the two. </p>
